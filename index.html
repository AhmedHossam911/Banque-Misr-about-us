Currently, BM owns shares in 157 companies across different fields, ranging from finance, tourism, housing, agriculture and food, and communication and information technology.

        <h2>Responsible Banking and Sustainability</h2>
        <p>Driven by its first mission, Banque Misr’s full compliance with the best sustainability practices at a very early stage has been reinforcing its distinctive leadership position in the markets where it operates. Banque Misr strategically capitalizes on sustainability performance to deliver on the targets as envisioned by the UN’s 2030 Agenda and prominently prioritizes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted regarding its substantial socioeconomic and ecological impacts. Working together, we further integrate the principles of good governance across the bank’s operations.

As a leading financial institution in Egypt, Banque Misr gives great importance to corporate social responsibility and adheres to the UN Global Compact ten standards, which include the following; non-discrimination, equality, human rights, abolition of human labor, health and safety, governance and anti-corruption. The bank also takes into consideration all other standards in relation to achieve sustainability through assessing the environmental impact of activities related to performance indicators on all fronts.

'Banque Misr  was keen as the first Egyptian government-owned bank, was keen to report on its business operations according to the GRI standards. The GRI standards mean that the business activities are compliant with sustainability principles through governance, human rights, anti-corruption, society participation, environmental standards, transparency, and disclosure.

Banque Misr signed the United Nations Environment Programme's Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). The initiative aims at achieving sustainable development and social and environmental responsibility by institutions. This latest move places Banque Misr among responsible banks that conduct their business in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement.The announcement was made during the United Nations General Assembly annual meeting that took place on 22 September 2019 in New York.</p>

      <div id="financial-inclusion" class="content-section">
        <h2>Literacy and Financial Inclusion</h2>
        <p>The concept of financial inclusion involves offering financial services to all segments of society – whether they be individuals or institutions – and striving to enable these segments to utilize such services, by providing financial services that are of an acceptable quality and a reasonable price through official financial channels.

          Banque Misr is considered one of the first banks to lay the foundations of financial inclusion, being the first bank to be established with Egyptian capital for the purpose of investing the savings of Egyptians and integrating these savings into the formal national economy. As such, the Bank consistently supports the efforts of the Egyptian state towards fulfilling financial inclusion, with the aim of allowing all social segments access to financial products and services that fulfil their various needs; especially Egyptian youths, which constitute the largest segment of society. Banque Misr has partaken in numerous initiatives and events that seek to drive these efforts; such as the national initiative launched by the Egyptian Banking Institute, “Ashan Bokra” in 2012, under the auspices of the Central Bank of Egypt, in the area of financial education and the development of financial products and services that suit children and youths in Egypt and the Middle East. This is in addition to the Bank’s regular participation in the Arab Day for Financial Inclusion, International Youth Day, and other functions.</p>
